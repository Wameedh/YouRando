# Images Directory

This directory contains images used in the YouRando application, specifically the screenshot images for the Google Takeout process.

## Required Images:

The following images should be added to this directory:

1. `takeout-step1.png` - Screenshot of Google Takeout homepage
2. `takeout-step2.png` - Screenshot of selecting YouTube data
3. `takeout-step3.png` - Screenshot of customizing YouTube data to select only history
4. `takeout-step4.png` - Screenshot of export options

## Image Guidelines:

- Images should be in PNG format
- Recommended width: 600-800px
- Keep file sizes under 200KB for optimal loading
- Use screenshots that are clear and easy to follow
- Consider adding highlights or annotations for clarity

## Creating Screenshots:

To create these screenshots:
1. Go to [Google Takeout](https://takeout.google.com/)
2. Follow the process of selecting YouTube data and configuring the export
3. Take screenshots at each key step
4. Crop and optimize the images before adding them here

If images are not available, the application will gracefully hide the image containers.
